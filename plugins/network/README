Basic information:
==================

  Tests management:    supervisor and test manager script
     Tests timeout:    yes
Sequential testing:    yes
  Parallel testing:    yes


This implementation runs two containers:

1. Application container - a container with tested application (like httpd);
   this container should provide some network service and must export port/ports
   on which it does so.
2. Test container - a container for running tests against the application
   container (with the tested application); the test container should be based
   on some GNU/Linux distribution with package manager for easy installation
   of all the required dependencies.

Tests inside the test container are timeouted and they can also use environment
variables ($AC_ADDR, $AC_PORT) which are exported automatically inside the test
container and are referring to the application container.
